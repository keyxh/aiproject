# AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) Project

This project aims to implement a truly general artificial intelligence system using OpenAI API as the underlying model interface.

## Architecture Overview

The AGI system is designed with a modular architecture that includes:
- Cognitive Core: Central processing unit for reasoning and decision making
- Memory System: Short-term and long-term memory management
- Learning Engine: Continuous learning and adaptation capabilities
- Interface Layer: Communication with external systems and users
- Safety Module: Ethical constraints and safety measures

## Components

### 1. Cognitive Core
The cognitive core is responsible for high-level reasoning, problem solving, and decision making. It integrates multiple AI models and algorithms to simulate human-like thinking processes.

### 2. Memory System
The memory system handles both episodic and semantic memory. It stores experiences, knowledge, and learned patterns to enable continuous learning and contextual understanding.

### 3. Learning Engine
The learning engine enables the system to continuously improve its performance based on interactions and feedback. It implements reinforcement learning and transfer learning techniques.

### 4. Interface Layer
Provides APIs and communication protocols for interaction with users, other systems, and data sources.

### 5. Safety Module
Ensures ethical behavior, prevents harmful outputs, and maintains security controls.

## Implementation Strategy

The system will be built using a microservices architecture with the following principles:
- Scalability: Each component can scale independently
- Modularity: Components are loosely coupled
- Resilience: Fault-tolerant design
- Security: End-to-end encryption and access controls

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Python/Node.js
- AI Models: OpenAI GPT series
- Database: PostgreSQL, Redis, Vector databases
- Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana

## Roadmap

Phase 1: Basic cognitive framework
Phase 2: Memory system implementation
Phase 3: Learning engine integration
Phase 4: Interface layer development
Phase 5: Safety module implementation
Phase 6: Testing and validation
Phase 7: Deployment and monitoring
