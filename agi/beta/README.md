# AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) Project

## Overview
This project aims to implement an Artificial General Intelligence system using OpenAI API as the underlying model interface. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and capable of handling multiple cognitive tasks.

## Architecture
The AGI system consists of several core components:
- Memory System: For storing and retrieving information
- Reasoning Engine: For logical inference and decision making
- Learning Module: For acquiring new knowledge
- Communication Interface: For interaction with users and other systems
- Task Manager: For coordinating different activities

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API
- Redis for memory storage
- PostgreSQL for persistent data

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set environment variables for API keys
3. Run the main application: `python agi_main.py`
