# AGI - Artificial General Intelligence

## Overview
This project aims to implement an Artificial General Intelligence system using OpenAI API as the underlying model interface.

## Architecture
The AGI system follows a modular architecture with the following components:
- Cognitive Core: Main reasoning and decision-making engine
- Memory System: Short-term and long-term memory management
- Learning Module: Continuous learning and adaptation capabilities
- Interface Layer: Communication with external systems and users

## Design Principles
- Modularity: Each component can be developed and tested independently
- Scalability: Designed to handle increasing complexity and data volume
- Flexibility: Adaptable to different domains and use cases
- Safety: Built-in safety mechanisms and ethical considerations

## Implementation Strategy
1. Start with a basic cognitive framework
2. Integrate OpenAI API for natural language understanding and generation
3. Implement memory systems for context retention
4. Add learning capabilities for continuous improvement
5. Develop safety measures and ethical guidelines
6. Create user interfaces for interaction

## Technologies
- Python: Primary programming language
- OpenAI API: For language models and reasoning
- Vector databases: For memory storage
- Web frameworks: For interface layer
- Security libraries: For safety and privacy
