Install OpenAI Python package:\n    ```bash\n    pip install openai\n    ```\n\n2. Obtain an OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).\n\n3. Set the API key in the `agi.py` file:\n    ```python\n    api_key = 'your_openai_api_key_here'\n    ```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo generate a response, simply call the `generate_response` method on an instance of the `AGI` class:\n    ```python\n    from agi import AGI\n    agi_instance = AGI(api_key=api_key)\n    response = agi_instance.generate_response(prompt='What is the weather like today?')\n    print(response)\n    ```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome.
