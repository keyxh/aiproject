Install OpenAI Python client:\n    ```bash\n    pip install openai\n    ```\n\n2. Set your OpenAI API key in a secure place and replace `'your_openai_api_key_here'` with it in `agi.py`.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo generate a response:\n    ```python\n    from agi import AGI\n    agi_instance = AGI(api_key='your_openai_api_key_here')\n    prompt = 'Explain the concept of artificial general intelligence in simple terms.'\n    response = agi_instance.generate_response(prompt=prompt)\n    print(response)\n    ```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome.
